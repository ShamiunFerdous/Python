# We can do multiline comments using """ """ or ''' '''.
# We can use \n to create new line in the print statement.

print("I am a good boy \nI am not a good student") # \n is used to create new line

print("Python", "Java", "C++", sep=" | ", end="!!\n")
print("Programming is fun!")

'''
The sep parameter defines the separator between multiple values in a print() function.
By default, sep is a single space (" ").

The end parameter defines what should be printed at the end of the output.
By default, end is a newline (\n), which means print() moves to a new line after execution.
